HTTP was first documented in RFC 2068 in 1997. That specification was obsoleted by RFC 2616 in 1999, which was 
likewise replaced by the RFC 7230 family of RFCs in 2014.
HTTP is a more efficient expression of HTTP's semantics "on the wire", and was published in 2015; it is 
now supported by virtually all web browsers[2] and major web servers over Transport Layer Security (TLS) 
using an Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) extension[3] where TLS 1.2 or newer is required.[4][5]
HTTP is the proposed successor to HTTP/2,[6][7] which is already in use on the web (enabled by default in latest macOS), 
using UDP instead of TCP for the underlying transport protocol. Like HTTP/2, it does not obsolete previous major 
versions of the protocol. 
Support for HTTP/3 was added to Cloudflare and Google Chrome in September 2019,[8][9] and can be enabled in the 
stable versions of Chrome and Firefox
